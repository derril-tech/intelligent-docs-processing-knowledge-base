Document Processing and Knowledge Base

# Product Description / Presentation #


### **Product Description**

The **Intelligent Document Processing and Knowledge Base** is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform designed to transform unstructured and semi-structured documents into a rich, accessible, and actionable knowledge base. It eliminates the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process of data entry and document review, enabling organizations to unlock critical insights hidden within their documents and make smarter, data-driven decisions.

This system is more than just a document-scanning tool; it's an end-to-end solution that ingests documents from various sources, understands their content and context using advanced AI, and seamlessly integrates the extracted information into a centralized, searchable knowledge hub.

### **Key Features**

* **Intelligent Document Ingestion**: Supports the intake of documents from multiple sources, including emails, scanners, file uploads (PDFs, images, etc.), and APIs.
* **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Utilizes a combination of technologies such as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Machine Learning** to accurately extract relevant information from various document typesâ€”from structured forms to complex, unstructured contracts.
* **Dynamic Document Classification**: Automatically categorizes documents by type (e.g., invoices, contracts, medical records, financial statements) and routes them to the appropriate workflows.
* **Data Validation and Verification**: Implements rules-based and cross-document validation to ensure data accuracy. A "Human-in-the-Loop" feature allows for human review and correction of flagged discrepancies, continuously improving the AI model's performance.
* **Knowledge Base Creation**: Transforms the extracted data into a searchable, structured, and interconnected knowledge base. Users can query the knowledge base using natural language to find specific information, identify trends, and discover relationships between different documents.
* **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate with existing business systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Business Intelligence (BI) tools, to automate downstream processes and enhance data accessibility.
* **Scalability and Security**: Built to handle high volumes of documents and scale with business growth. It includes robust security measures like data encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.

### **User Flow & Mission**

The mission is to automate the entire document-to-knowledge pipeline, freeing up employees from repetitive data tasks and empowering them to focus on high-value, strategic work.

1.  **Ingest Documents**: A user or automated system uploads documents to the platform.
2.  **Process and Extract**: The system automatically classifies the documents and extracts all relevant data points.
3.  **Review and Refine**: Any data flagged for human review is sent to a validation queue, where a user can quickly correct and approve the information, which in turn trains the AI for future accuracy.
4.  **Populate Knowledge Base**: The extracted and validated data is stored in a centralized, searchable knowledge base.
5.  **Query and Act**: Users can then search, analyze, and gain insights from the consolidated data, using it to inform decisions, respond to inquiries, or trigger automated workflows.



FOLLOW THIS 8 STEP PLAN TO PREPARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------

# ðŸš€ Claude Fullstack Repo Prep â€“ Optimized 8 Step Plan

  
The goal: build an extensive frontend + backend scaffold so Claude Code only has to finish ~20% of the work.  
Each step must be **completed ** before advancing  (this is important).
IMPORTANT: YOU ARE BUILDING ONLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION NOT THE APPLICATION ITSELF !!!. FOLLOW THE STEPS IN NUMERICAL ORDER !!! starting from step 1.
You are doing the groundwork for the application, including setting up the folder structure, configuration files, and any necessary boilerplate code.
IMPORTANT: the checklist in each step has to be checked off 100% before moving to the next step. And always provide comments to your code blocks so that even a non-tech person can understand what you have done.

---

## STEP 1 â€” Build the Rich Infrastructure
Create a **deep scaffold** for both frontend and backend so Claude code can recognize the architecture immediately.

- Build a **frontend app shell** with routing, placeholder pages, components, and styling setup.  
- Build a **backend app shell** with API structure, health endpoint, and config in place.  
- Include `REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, and a draft `CLAUDE.md` in the `docs/` folder.  (create the docs folder if it does not  already exist)
- Add **TODO markers and folder-level `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** files so Claude knows exactly where to add logic.

**Deliverables**
- Frontend app shell with routing, placeholder pages, components, and styling setup  
- Backend app shell with API structure, health endpoint, and config  
- `docs/REPO_MAP.md`, `docs/API_SPEC.md` (stub), and draft `docs/CLAUDE.md`  
- TODO markers + folder-level `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` files  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Frontend scaffold built  
- [ ] Backend scaffold built 
- [ ] Docs folder created with drafts (`REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)  
- [ ] TODO markers and `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` stubs in place  

---

## STEP 2 â€” Enrich the Scaffold
If the repo looks shallow, enrich it so Claude needs fewer leaps of imagination.  

Add:
- Sample frontend routes and components (`/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`)  
- Domain model stubs and types/interfaces  
- Mock data + fixtures for UI flows  
- README files with quick run instructions for both frontend and backend  
- Instructions embedded in folders (e.g. `CLAUDE_TASK: â€¦`)

**Deliverables**
- Sample routes and pages (`/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`)  
- Domain model stubs and type definitions  
- Mock data and fixtures for UI flows  
- README files for frontend and backend with run instructions  
- Folder-level instructions (`_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)  

**Checklist**
- [ ] At least 2â€“3 sample routes/pages exist  
- [ ] Domain types/interfaces stubbed out  
- [ ] Mock data + fixtures included  
- [ ] README_FRONTEND.md and README_BACKEND.md added  
- [ ] Each folder has `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` where relevant 

---

## STEP 3 â€” Audit for Alignment
Check that the scaffold actually matches the product brief, tech specs, and UX /UI goals.
Add additional UI/UX elements (if needed) to make the application visually appealing (and update the design requirements after that)

- Do navigation and pages reflect the productâ€™s main flows?  
- Do API endpoints match the UI needs?  
- Is the chosen tech stack consistent (no unused or conflicting libraries)?  
- Is the UX direction reflected (design tokens, layout, component stubs)?

**Deliverables**
- Alignment review across Product â†” UI/UX â†” Tech  
- Identify any missing flows, mismatched libraries, or conflicting instructions  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Navigation structure matches product journeys  
- [ ] Components/pages map to required features  
- [ ] API endpoints cover MVP needs  
- [ ] No contradictory or unused technologies  

---

## STEP 4 â€” Document the Architecture
Now make the docs **Claude-ready**:

- **REPO_MAP.md**: Full repo breakdown with roles of each folder  
- **API_SPEC.md**: Endpoints, payloads, error handling  
- **CLAUDE.md**: Editing rules, coding conventions, AI collaboration guidelines  

These three files are the **context backbone** Claude will use to understand the repo.

**Deliverables**
- `REPO_MAP.md`: full repo breakdown with folder purposes  
- `API_SPEC.md`: endpoints, models, error conventions  
- `CLAUDE.md`: collaboration rules, editing boundaries  

**Checklist**
- [ ] REPO_MAP.md fully describes structure  
- [ ] API_SPEC.md covers all MVP endpoints and schemas  
- [ ] CLAUDE.md includes project overview, editing rules, examples  

---

## STEP 5 â€” Improve the Prompt
Enhance the prompt (in `docs/PROMPT_DECLARATION.md`) with details Claude needs:

- FE/BE boundaries and data contracts  
- UX guidelines (states, accessibility, interaction patterns)  
- Performance budgets (bundle size, API latency)  
- Security constraints (auth, rate limits, PII handling)  
- Testing expectations (unit, integration, end-to-end)

**Deliverables**
- FE/BE boundaries and contracts  
- UX guidelines (states, accessibility, patterns)  
- Performance budgets (bundle size, latency targets)  
- Security constraints (auth, PII, rate limits)  
- Testing expectations  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Prompt includes FE/BE division of responsibility  
- [ ] UX principles and design tokens specified  
- [ ] Performance/security/testing requirements added  
- [ ] Prompt is concrete and actionable for Claude  

---

## STEP 6 â€” Expert Audit of the Prompt
Now do a **meticulous audit** of the one-page prompt declaration.

- Add Frontend Architecture, Backend Architecture, Design requirements, Core Integrations, Success Criteria, Implementation Guidelines and Security & Compliance categories from this Project Brief to the prompt declaration.
- Remove inconsistencies, duplicates, or unused technologies  
- Ensure Tech Stack â†’ Product â†’ Scaffold alignment (no mismatches)  
- Add UI/UX details that make the product visually appealing and usable  
- Double-check frontend and backend folders are ready  
- Confirm editing boundaries are clear (what Claude can/canâ€™t touch)  
- Make the declaration **battle-tested and handoff-ready**

**Deliverables**
- Remove inconsistencies/duplicates  
- Ensure stack â†” product â†” scaffold alignment  
- Add UI/UX and accessibility details  
- Clarify file boundaries (editable vs do-not-touch)  
- Confirm prompt uses Claude-friendly syntax  

**Checklist**
- [ ] No unused or contradictory tech remains  
- [ ] UI/UX directives are product-specific and sufficient  
- [ ] Editing boundaries explicitly defined  
- [ ] Prompt syntax uses clear, imperative instructions  

---

## STEP 7 â€” Birdâ€™s-Eye Repo Review
Do a quick top-level scan for missing pieces:

- All folders contain either code or `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- `.env.example` files exist for both frontend and backend  
- CI/CD config is present and not trivially broken  
- Run scripts (`npm run dev`, `uvicorn â€¦`) work end-to-end  
- No orphan TODOs without clear ownership

**Deliverables**
- Verify all core files exist  
- Confirm environment, CI, and scripts work end-to-end  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Every folder has code or `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- [ ] `.env.example` present for both frontend and backend  
- [ ] CI pipeline triggers and passes basic checks  
- [ ] Dev script (`scripts/dev.sh`) runs both FE and BE  

---

## STEP 8 â€” Finalize CLAUDE.md
This is where Claude gets its **onboarding pack**. Make sure `CLAUDE.md` includes:

- **Project Overview**: one-paragraph purpose, stack, goals, target users  
- **Folder & File Structure**: whatâ€™s editable vs do-not-touch  
- **Coding Conventions**: style guides, naming rules, commenting expectations  
- **AI Collaboration Rules**: response format, edit rules, ambiguity handling  
- **Editing Rules**: full-file vs patches, locked files  
- **Dependencies & Setup**: frameworks, services, env vars  
- **Workflow & Tools**: how to run locally, FE/BE boundary, deployment notes  
- **Contextual Knowledge**: product quirks, domain rules, business logic caveats  
- **Examples**: good vs bad AI answer

**Deliverables**
- Project overview (purpose, stack, goals, users)  
- Folder & file structure with editable vs do-not-touch  
- Coding conventions (style, naming, commenting)  
- AI collaboration rules (response style, edit rules, ambiguity handling)
